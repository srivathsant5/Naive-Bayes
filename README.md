# Naive Bayes Classifier from Scratch

  * The Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that is suitable for binary and multiclass classification.
  * Na√Øve Bayes performs well in cases of categorical input variables compared to numerical variables.
  * It is useful for making predictions and forecasting data based on historical results



  * This repository contains the code for a Naive Bayes classifier that was built from scratch. The classifier was implemented in Python and trained on a labeled dataset of 
Titanic Dataset. The model was designed to predict weather the person is Survived or not.

## Getting Started

To get started with this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone [https://github.com/srivathsant5/Naive-Bayes].
2. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Usuage

To use the Naive Bayes classifier, follow these steps:

1. We used OOPs concept to build Naive Bayes Classifier from skretch.
2. Run the naive_bayes.py script to train the model and make predictions on the test dataset.

## Results

The Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test dataset.
